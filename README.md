<p>
  A <b>Speech-to-Text Application</b> is a web-based tool that captures user speech through a microphone and converts it into written text in real-time. Built using  <b>HTML, CSS,</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> this project leverages the <b>browser's Speech Recognition API</b> for processing voice input and displaying the output dynamically.
